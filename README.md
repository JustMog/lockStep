lockstep
===

[fixed timestep](https://medium.com/@tglaiel/how-to-make-your-game-run-at-60fps-24c61210fe75) based gameloop for love2d with basic profiling functionality

Usage
---

Require lockStep.lua. Since it modifies love.run, it must be required outside of love callbacks such as love.load to have any effect.

```lua
local lockStep = require 'lockStep'
```

Documentation

- `lockStep.updateRate [default 60]`

Calls to love.update per second 

- `lockStep.maxUpdateDebt [default 8]`

Maximum number of timesteps the simulation is allowed to fall behind.
Further steps will be skipped to catch up, causing slowdown but preventing a "death spiral"

- `lockStep.dtSnap [default 0.0002]`

Maximum amount of time in seconds dt can be fudged by
to snap to nearby exact multiples of a timestep (i.e 1/lockStep.updateRate).

- `lockStep.averageOver [default 4]`

Number of frames to incorporate into rolling average of dt


```lua
lockStep.breakdown(x, y, w, h, [alpha])
```
Begin drawing a bar showing how long is spent in update (yellow) and draw (magenta)
as a proportion of the length of one timestep. if it exceeds 100%, the simulation will start to fall behind
and the game may suffer from slowdown.

```lua
lockStep.breakdown()
```
Stop drawing the bar.
